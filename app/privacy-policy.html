  <h1>Privacy Policy — Charaivati</h1>
  <p class="small">Last updated: <strong>2025-11-16</strong></p>

  <p>Charaivati (“we”, “us”, or “our”) operates https://www.charaivati.com (the “Service”). This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account & profile data:</strong> email and public profile if you sign in.</li>
    <li><strong>OAuth data:</strong> if you connect Google Drive, we may access file metadata and file content only with your explicit consent for features that require it.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> logs, device/browser information, IP address, and basic analytics to improve the Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the Service.</li>
    <li>Access and manage files on Google Drive only with your explicit consent to support features (e.g., file import/export).</li>
    <li>Security, fraud detection, debugging, and analytics.</li>
    <li>Communicate important updates and respond to support requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Google Drive & OAuth</h2>
  <p>When you authorize Charaivati to access your Google Drive via OAuth, you grant Charaivati permission to access only the scopes you approve. We will never access or transfer your files except to provide the feature you requested. You can revoke access from your Google Account security settings at any time.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share data with third-party services we use (hosting, analytics, email) under confidentiality obligations and only as necessary to provide the Service.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal data as long as needed for the Service and to comply with legal obligations. If you request deletion, we will remove your personal data from active systems within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request access, correction, or deletion of your personal data by contacting us at the address below. You can also revoke OAuth access through your Google Account settings.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We follow reasonable security practices to protect your data. However, no system is fully secure — if you find a vulnerability, see our <a href="/SECURITY.md">Security Policy</a> or contact us immediately.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions or requests: <a href="mailto:charaivati.forward@gmail.com">charaivati.forward@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. If material changes occur, we will post a clear notice on this page.</p>
