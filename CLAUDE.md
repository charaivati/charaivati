# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server with Turbopack
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run vercel-build # Prisma generate + next build (used on Vercel)

npx prisma generate  # Regenerate Prisma client after schema changes
npx prisma migrate dev --name <name>  # Create and apply a new migration
npx prisma studio    # Open Prisma Studio to browse the database
```

ESLint and TypeScript errors are ignored during builds (`ignoreDuringBuilds: true`, `ignoreBuildErrors: true`), so `npm run lint` is the way to catch lint issues in CI.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 15** App Router, **React 19**, TypeScript; `@react-pdf/renderer` for server-side PDF generation (listed in `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.mjs`)
- **PostgreSQL** via **Prisma 6** ORM (`lib/db.ts` exports `db`, `lib/prisma.ts` exports `prisma` — both are the same singleton)
- **Tailwind CSS v4**, `lucide-react`, `sonner` (toasts), `framer-motion`
- **Redis** via `@upstash/redis` and `ioredis` for caching (`lib/redis.ts`, `lib/cache-utils.ts`)
- **Cloudinary** for images/video, **AWS S3** for file storage, **Google Drive** integration
- **SendGrid** (email), **Twilio** (SMS via `lib/sendSms.ts`)
- **Leaflet** for maps, **Three.js** / `@react-three/fiber` for 3D, **D3** for geo/charts
- **Capacitor 8** for iOS/Android native shell — the app points to `https://charaivati.com/app/home`

### Route Groups
The `app/` directory uses Next.js route groups to co-locate layouts:

| Group | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `(with-nav)` | Main app pages: `/self`, `/society`, `/nation`, `/earth` |
| `(public)` | Unauthenticated pages: privacy policy, terms, sahayak |
| `(auth)` | Login/register flows |
| `(business)` | Business idea/plan evaluation |
| `(earth)` | Earth-layer views |
| `(universe)` | Universe-layer view |
| `(User)` | User profile and editing |
| `(locality)` | Country selection, local area |
| `(state)` | State-level view |
| `app/` | **Mobile shell** — Capacitor-wrapped layout with sticky header + bottom nav |

The platform uses a 6-layer conceptual model: **Self → Society → State → Nation → Earth → Universe**, each with tabs for different analyses.

### Authentication
- Sessions use JWT via `jose`, stored in `charaivati.session` (dev) / `__Host-session` (prod) cookies — see `lib/session.ts`
- `middleware.ts` protects `/self`, `/nation`, `/earth`, `/society` — unauthenticated requests redirect to `/login`
- `getCurrentUser(req)` in `lib/session.ts` decodes the session cookie and fetches the user from the database
- API routes read the session cookie via `getTokenFromRequest(req)` from `lib/session.ts`
- Auth flows also support OTP (`/api/auth/otp/`), magic links (`/api/auth/send-magic-link`), and CSRF tokens (`/api/auth/csrf`)

### Guest Account Merge
Guests get a real `User` row with `status: "guest"` and no email. On sign-in or email verification all guest data is atomically moved to the real account.

- **`lib/mergeGuest.ts`** — `mergeGuestToReal(guestId, realId)`: single DB transaction that transfers cart items (quantities merged), wishlist, pinned stores, page follows (initiatives, courses), addresses, orders, owned Pages (initiatives/courses/health businesses), and owned Stores — then deletes the guest user. Calling it twice is safe: duplicate-key conflicts are skipped and a missing guest is a no-op.
- **Trigger 1 — login** (`app/api/user/login/route.ts`): after `createSessionToken`, reads the existing cookie and calls `mergeGuestToReal` if it contains a guest session. Non-blocking — failures are logged but don't abort login.
- **Trigger 2 — email verification** (`app/api/user/magic/route.ts`): prefers `meta.guestId` stored in the magic link at registration time (works even when the email is opened in a different browser/app), falls back to the live cookie. Fires before the redirect to `/login`.
- **`meta.guestId` baking** (`app/api/user/register/route.ts`): at registration the current cookie is read; if it is a guest session, `guestId` is written into `MagicLink.meta` JSON so the merge survives any browser switch.
- **Manual merge** — `POST /api/user/claim-guest` accepts `{ guestId }` and merges that guest into the currently authenticated real user. Use for retroactive recovery of orders placed before the automatic flow existed.
- **`/api/user/me` now returns `status`** — client components detect guest mode from `user.status === "guest"` without a separate API call.
- **Guest UI** — `app/store/[id]/layout.tsx` (store nav) and `app/app/layout.tsx` (app shell) check `isGuest` and replace the account/sign-out links with a single "Sign in / Sign up" link to `/login?redirect=<current path>`.

### Database
- Schema lives in `prisma/schema.prisma` — 100+ models covering users, businesses, e-commerce (stores, carts, orders), social (friends, chat, posts), learning (courses, timelines), health, and geo data
- After editing `schema.prisma`, always run `npx prisma generate` and create a migration
- Chat messages use ECDH P-256 end-to-end encryption (`lib/chat-crypto.ts`)

### API Routes
All API routes live under `app/api/`. Key areas:
- `app/api/auth/` — login, logout, OTP, magic link, CSRF
- `app/api/user/` — profile, avatar, verification, deletion, guest-to-real merge (`/api/user/claim-guest`)
- `app/api/social/` — posts, limits, proxy
- `app/api/business/` — idea scoring, plan generation/analysis
- `app/api/store/` — store management, blocks, sections, cart, orders
- `app/api/friends/` — friend requests, accept/decline/remove

#### Store orders GET params
`GET /api/store/orders` supports three modes:
- No params → returns the **current user's own purchases** (buyer view)
- `?storeId=X` → returns orders for that store (owner only); add `&status=delivered` (or any status) to filter
- `?all=true` → returns orders across **all stores owned** by the current user; each order includes `store { id, name }`

#### Two order creation paths
- `POST /api/store/orders` — **cart-based**: fetches cart items, creates Order, clears cart
- `POST /api/store/orders/quick` — **express (Buy Now)**: accepts `{ storeId, addressId, items[], billingProfileId? }` directly; never reads or modifies the cart table

#### Billing profiles
- `GET/POST /api/store/billing-profiles` — list or create `BillingProfile` records
- `PATCH/DELETE /api/store/billing-profiles/[profileId]` — update or delete
- Each profile: `legalName` (required), `companyName`, GST block (`gstRegistered Boolean`, `gstin`, `gstState`, `annualTurnover`), billing address fields, optional `linkedStoreId`
- Managed in `/store/account?tab=invoice` — Tax & Compliance toggle replaces the old plain "GST Number" input
- Users select a billing profile during checkout (`QuickOrderModal` step 3 / `CheckoutModal` step 2); selected profile is serialised into `Order.invoiceData` JSON at order-creation time — no FK stored on Order

### Store Slugs
Every store has a `slug String? @unique` field. Slugs are generated from the store name using `lib/store/generateSlug.ts` and assigned at creation time.

- **Resolution**: `GET /api/store/[id]` accepts either a cuid or a slug. Cuids (`/^c[a-z0-9]{24}$/i`) resolve via `findUnique`. Everything else resolves via `SELECT id FROM "Store" WHERE slug = $1` raw SQL (Prisma-client-agnostic).
- **Canonical redirect**: If a store page or section page is loaded using a cuid URL and the store has a slug, the page calls `router.replace()` to the slug URL. Browser bar always shows the slug after load.
- **Slug in responses**: `GET /api/store/[id]` always returns `slug` via an explicit raw SQL lookup appended to the response. All store-listing APIs (`/api/store/all`, `/api/store/pinned`, `/api/store/my-stores`, `/api/store/orders`, `/api/store/wishlist`) also include slug via the `getStoreSlugs` batch helper.
- **`lib/store/generateSlug.ts`** — `generateSlug(name)` (lowercase, hyphens) + `randomSuffix()` for collision avoidance
- **`lib/store/getStoreSlugs.ts`** — `getStoreSlugs(ids[])` returns `Record<id, slug|null>` via a single `SELECT id, slug FROM "Store" WHERE id IN (...)` raw SQL; used by all APIs to inject slug without depending on the Prisma typed client
- **Backfill**: `scripts/migrateStoreSlugs.ts` — run once to assign slugs to stores created before the field was added

### Store Order Pages
- `/store/account?tab=stores` — owner order dashboard; "All Orders" pill aggregates across all stores; "View all →" goes to `/store/orders/all`
- `/store/orders/all` — full view of all orders across every store the user owns; store name shown as chip
- `/store/[storeSlug]/orders` — per-store active orders with status-update controls; "Delivered Orders →" button in header
- `/store/[storeSlug]/orders/delivered` — read-only archive of delivered orders for one store; "← Active Orders" back link

### Buy Now / Quick Order UX
- "Buy Now" button on product cards opens `QuickOrderModal` (ephemeral React state — never touches cart)
- "Add to Cart" button flashes green "✓ Added" for 2 seconds on successful add
- `QuickOrderModal` steps: Items review (with inline qty stepper) → Delivery address → Invoice profile (optional, from billing profiles) → Confirmation
- Managed in `components/store/QuickOrderModal.tsx`
- Also available on the **Saved Products** page (`/app/saved`) — wishlist items have a "Buy Now" button that opens `QuickOrderModal` directly

### Invoice System
Auto-generated on delivery, owner signs, buyer downloads. Routes live at `app/api/orders/[orderId]/invoice/`.

Flow:
1. Owner marks order **delivered** → `POST /api/orders/[orderId]/invoice` auto-fires
2. PDF rendered server-side via `@react-pdf/renderer`; `invoiceType` is `"tax_invoice"` if seller's `BillingProfile.gstRegistered === true`, else `"bill_of_supply"`
3. PDF uploaded to Cloudinary as `resource_type: "raw", type: "authenticated"` (access-controlled) → `invoiceUrl` saved
4. Owner downloads unsigned PDF, signs it, uploads signed copy via `POST /api/orders/[orderId]/invoice/sign`
5. `invoiceSignedUrl` saved (via `$executeRaw`); buyer sees **Signed Invoice** download in My Purchases

Download proxy: `GET /api/orders/[orderId]/invoice/download` — authenticates the caller (buyer or store owner), derives `public_id` deterministically (`invoices/{orderId}` or `invoices/signed/{orderId}_signed`), calls `cloudinary.utils.private_download_url()` with `type: "authenticated"`, fetches the signed URL server-to-server, streams PDF back with `Content-Disposition: attachment`.

Key facts:
- Cloudinary storage is `type: "authenticated"` — raw Cloudinary URLs are **not** publicly accessible; always go through the download proxy
- `public_id` for the unsigned invoice is always `invoices/{orderId}` (no file extension); signed is `invoices/signed/{orderId}_signed`
- `Order.invoiceData Json?` stores the buyer's billing details captured at checkout (inline, no FK to BillingProfile)
- All six invoice fields (`invoiceNumber`, `invoiceUrl`, `invoiceType`, `invoiceGenAt`, `invoiceSignedUrl`, `invoiceSignedAt`) live on the `Order` model
- Buyer orders GET (`/api/store/orders` no params) augments results with `invoiceSignedUrl` via raw SQL because the Prisma client may not know about this field when stale
- Cloud name env var is `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` — there is **no** separate `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`; server routes read the public var
- **GST tax invoice and e-invoice cases pending testing** — the `"tax_invoice"` branch and `annualTurnover: "above_5Cr"` (IRN required) paths exist in the PDF template and billing profile UI but have not been end-to-end tested with a real GSTIN

### Product Ratings
- One rating (1–5 stars) per user per product (`ProductRating` model, `@@unique([productId, userId])`)
- Store owners cannot rate their own products (403 from the rate API)
- **Batch fetch**: when a section page loads, it fetches ratings for all visible products in a single `GET /api/store/products/ratings?ids=id1,id2,...` call using `groupBy` aggregates; never one request per product
- `StarRating` component in the section page: hover highlights, click to rate, "Thanks for rating!" flash, owner sees display-only stars with inline message, logged-out users see display-only stars with "Log in to rate." message
- API: `POST /api/store/products/[productId]/rate`, `GET /api/store/products/[productId]/rating`, `GET /api/store/products/ratings?ids=`

### Inline Quantity Stepper
- Each product card on section pages has an inline `QtyStepperInline` component in the title row: `−` | number | `+`
- The number is directly editable (click → input, blur/Enter commits, validates 1–99)
- The selected qty is passed to both `onAddToCart(qty)` and `onBuyNow(qty)` — the cart API increments by `qty`, and `QuickOrderModal` opens with `quantity: qty` pre-loaded

### Store Image Pool
All store image uploads go through a two-layer dedup pipeline — **never call Cloudinary directly** from store upload forms.

- **Utility**: `lib/store/uploadImage.ts` exports `uploadStoreImage(file, storeId)`:
  1. SHA-256 hash the file client-side (`crypto.subtle`)
  2. `POST /api/store/images/check` → returns existing record immediately if hash exists (`alreadyExisted: true`)
  3. Upload to Cloudinary (`cloud: dyphnp3oc`, `preset: posts_unsigned`, `public_id = fileHash`)
  4. `POST /api/store/images/save` → upsert on `[storeId, fileHash]`
- **DB constraint**: `@@unique([storeId, fileHash])` on `StoreImage` is the hard guarantee against duplicates
- **API**: `POST /api/store/images/check`, `POST /api/store/images/save`, `GET /api/store/images/list?storeId=`
- **Legacy path** (`/api/store/[id]/images`) still exists for the bulk library modal; it now uses new field names
- **`StoreImage` fields**: `id`, `storeId`, `url`, `cloudinaryId`, `fileHash`, `fileName`, `uploadedAt` — old fields `name`, `imageUrl`, `imageKey`, `createdAt` no longer exist

## Known Footguns (read these before touching anything)
- `/docs/modules/auth-files.md` — `lib/auth.ts` vs `lib/session.ts` are NOT interchangeable
- `/docs/modules/auth.md` — middleware does NOT protect API routes
- `/docs/flows/add-new-api-route.md` — CSRF is built but unwired, do not add it
- `/docs/modules/profile-schemas.md` — `heightCm`/`weightKg` exist in two out-of-sync places
- **Two order endpoints exist** — `POST /api/store/orders` (cart-based, clears cart) vs `POST /api/store/orders/quick` (express, never touches cart). Do not use the cart-based endpoint from `QuickOrderModal` — it will empty the user's persistent cart.
- **`QuickOrderModal` is ephemeral** — closing it mid-flow loses all state. It never writes to DB until "Place Order" is clicked.
- **Store slug resolution uses raw SQL** — `Store.slug` is not in the Prisma generated client until you run `prisma generate` after a successful `db push`. Use `$queryRaw`/`$executeRaw` for any query that reads or filters by `slug`; do not put `slug` in a Prisma `where` or `select` block while the client is stale. After restarting the dev server and re-running `prisma generate`, the typed client works normally.
- **`ProductRating.productId` points to `StoreBlock`** — the relation is declared on `StoreBlock` (mapped to the `Block` table). Querying product ratings requires using the block's `id`, not any separate product ID.
- **`StoreImage` field names changed** — old fields `name`, `imageUrl`, `imageKey`, `createdAt` no longer exist. Current fields: `url`, `fileHash`, `cloudinaryId`, `fileName`, `uploadedAt`. Any code reading `storeImage.imageUrl` or `storeImage.name` will be undefined.
- **Never call Cloudinary directly for store images** — always use `uploadStoreImage()` from `lib/store/uploadImage.ts`. Direct calls bypass the dedup check and DB save, creating orphaned Cloudinary assets and missed dedup hits.
- **`Order.items` is a flat JSON snapshot** — the field contains `[{ blockId, title, price, quantity, imageUrl }]`. It is NOT a Prisma relation. Any frontend type that uses `{ block: { title, price } }` will silently get `undefined` for all values. Always type it as `{ blockId: string; title: string; price: number; quantity: number }[]`.
- **Invoice download never exposes Cloudinary URLs** — invoices are stored as `type: "authenticated"` on Cloudinary. The raw `invoiceUrl` / `invoiceSignedUrl` stored on `Order` are private URLs that return 401 without a signed token. Always route downloads through `GET /api/orders/[orderId]/invoice/download`, which generates a 60-second signed URL server-side.
